# Homework10_Time_Series

I need to spend more time regaridng the in-sample/out-of-sample areas of this work. The Time Series portion was pretty straightforward and I'm more familiar with that material. 
The ARIMA, ARMA, and GARCH models well relatively easy to reproduce following along with the class activites. The Sklearn Linear Regression excercises were more difficult for me
to comprehend and without following along with the class activities line by line I would have been completely lost. I am going to spend some more time on them, but with 
the HW due, wanted to make sure I got at least credit for it.
